    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tonkotsu ramen is a Japanese noodle soup made with a pork bone brothâ€”ton means pork and kotsu means bone.
        When collagen-rich pig parts like pork trotters and neck bones are cooked in water over high heat, 
        the collagen in the connective tissue transforms into gelatin, which gives bone broth its sliky texture.</p>
